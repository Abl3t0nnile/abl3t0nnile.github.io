      <description>Learning new things is fun! It&amp;rsquo;s energizing and if I really get into something I can&amp;rsquo;t let go of it. I get in over my head. I tend to choose a try-first-look-up-later style of learning. I love to tinker around and if I encounter a problem, I browse the web to find a solution. This often leads to chaos and surely minimizes my learning goals. Now and then I thought about starting a blog to keep track of my ideas and learnings, organize my efforts and saving me from re-learning a lot of things again and agin, because I didn&amp;rsquo;t took my time.</description>
