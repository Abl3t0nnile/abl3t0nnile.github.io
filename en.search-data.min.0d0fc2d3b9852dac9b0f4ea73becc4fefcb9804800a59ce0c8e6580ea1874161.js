The tools used for this purpose are HUGO, GitHub with GitHub pages and the command line. At the end of this tutorial I will cover automated post creation and site updates using shell functions. Since I\u0026rsquo;m using ZSH as my shell - if you\u0026rsquo;re on BASH, these may not work exactly the same for you. But everything else on the command line should work the same on either ZSH or BASH. This tutorial does not cover HUGO installation or basic git usage. If the HUGO commands used in this tutorial work without any error messages you are probably fine.\nThe following topics are mandatory and won\u0026rsquo;t be covered in this tutorial\n A working installation of Hugo Basic git knowledge A GitHub account Markdown syntax   1 Hugo #  Hugo is one of the key components for this project. Hugo is a open-source static site generator. Once installed it can be used inside the command line to build static websites from markdown files. The tool comes with a powerful theme engine and is customizable using templates. Hugo builds the mandatory file system during project creation and is later configured using a config.toml file. Hugo lets you create your content as pure markdown files, extend them with a file header and publish them directly to your website, only from the command line. In combination with the right theme this is all you need, if you know your way around git and the terminal, to run your website. I find it a lot easier to deal with, then with wordpress and co.\nHugo has a lot more to offer, than this tutorial covers. For further reading, check the projects homepage.\n2 Project creation #  Before we can start configuring, styling and filling our page with content, we need to build a new Hugo project and set up the connection with github pages.\n2.1 Github setup #  A project like this consists of two github repositories. One so called production repo, which contains the static files, github pages will then host our site of, and one repository, I will call the blog repo from now on, cause mine is named this way. If you\u0026rsquo;re building a portfolio or some other kind of page feel free to use another name. The second repository will contain the actual code and configuration for the site. The blog repo will later be linked by a submodule to the production repo, to push changes to the site directly to the live version. Go ahead an create two public repositories with no initial content:\n create code repo and name it as you like create production repo and name it \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;.github.io  Since we are using a personal github page for our project, the name of the production repo has to be \u0026lt;github_username\u0026gt;.github.io. Each account is limited to a single personal page, but each repo to a project can have its own site (the setup process is a little bit different).\nCreate a project folder for your local files. I put mine directly into my home directory, since I will have to access it a lot in the future and named it webpage.\n~ $ mkdir webpage ~ $ cd webpage This folder will contain the local versions of both repositories and will act as the root directory of the project. Here you can create folders for other files, that are project related, but not part or content of the actual site. Im keeping the photoshop files for feature image templates here for instance. Data outside the two cloned repository folders, is not part of any git repository. Let\u0026rsquo;s continue by actually cloning the two repos:\n~/webpage $ git clone https://github.com/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/blog.git ~/webpage $ git clone https://github.com/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;.github.io.git After cloning the repos we will checkout the main branch, add README.md and .gitignore to both of them and push the changes to origin.\n~/webpage $ cd blog # Create main branch an switch to it ~//blog $ git checkout -b main # Create files ~//blog $ touch README.md ~//blog $ touch .gitignore # Stage and commit changes ~//blog $ git add . ~//blog $ git commit -m \u0026#39;initial commit\u0026#39; # Push changes to origin/main ~//blog $ git push origin main Repeat these steps for the production repo and you\u0026rsquo;re good to go for the next step.\n2.2 Create Hugo project #  Let\u0026rsquo;s start building our Hugo project, by changing to the blog folder and create a new Hugo project there:\n~/webpage $ cd blog # Hugo command to build a new project hugo new site \u0026lt;website-name\u0026gt; The hugo new site command did all the heavy lifting for us, by creating a lot of boiler plate code, and the mandatory file structure, in order for hugo to work properly. The project structure should look something like this right now:\n. └── /webpage └── /blog (git repository) | ├── /project | | ├── /content | | └── lots of other Hugo files ... | └── .git_files ├── /production (git repository) \u0026lt;-- named \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;.github.io | └── .git_files └── /resources The names for these folders will be used consistently in this tutorial from now on, since they are the naming conventions my live version follows.\n2.3 Establish repository connection #  The final setup step is to connect the blog repository to the production repo. In order to do so, we have to create a submodule of production inside blog and store it inside a folder called public.\n~/webpage $ cd blog # Switch to the directory of the hugo project ~//blog $ cd project # Create submodule from main branch of repo and clone it to the public folder ~///project $ git submodule add -b main \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;.github.io public Since Hugo will later save the generated static files into the public folder, we now have created a direct link to our live version of the page. Whenever we add or change files in our blog repo and update the page with Hugo, we only have to push the changes, made to webpage/blog/project/public, to origin, to update the live web-site. We can now continue by establishing our local file system and setting up Hugo.\n3 Configure Hugo #  We now have everything set up correctly and can start building the actual page and filling it with content.\n3.1 Choosing a theme #  Choosing a theme is a key part of the creation process. I wanted a site, where I can easily manage my content and sort it by categories. My goal is to build a resource page for myself, where I can look up things I already learned. By creating these posts I will settle my new knowledge. I found that uBlogger fits the needs I have the most, but there are tons of other themes on the Hugo Themes page. If you want to follow along, go with uBlogger, otherwise choose a different theme, but the configuration and content management principles may vary from theme to theme.\nFor most themes navigate to the themes github repo and copy its link to clone it into your project. It seems to be best practice to submodule the theme rather than simply cloning it. Some themes may have different installing instructions specified in their documentation.\n~//blog $ cd project ~//blog $ git submodule add https://github.com/upagge/uBlogger.git themes/uBlogger This creates a submodule of the desired theme inside our blog repo. If the theme is later updated, we can simply pull changes from the original repository of the theme. In order to apply the theme to the page, change its name and further personalize it, we need to dive into the configuration process.\n3.2 Configuration #  The configuration process is a big part of the page setup and personalization process. I will add further details about the different parts of the config, as I tweak this page. For now a complete example with comments should do it.\nExample configuration # ----------------------- # PAGE CONFIGURATION FILE # ----------------------- # # -------------------- # Global configuration # -------------------- # # website title title = \u0026#34;a coding monkey\u0026#34;

Swift was developed as a replacement for Apple\u0026rsquo;s earlier programming language Objective-C, as Objective-C had been largely unchanged since the early 1980s and lacked modern language features. Swift works with Apple\u0026rsquo;s Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, and a key aspect of Swift\u0026rsquo;s design was the ability to interoperate with the huge body of existing Objective-C code developed for Apple products over the previous decades. It is built with the open source LLVM compiler framework and has been included in Xcode since version 6, released in 2014. On Apple platforms, it uses the Objective-C runtime library which allows C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to run within one program.\nSwift was introduced at Apple\u0026rsquo;s 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). It underwent an upgrade to version 1.2 during 2014 and a major upgrade to Swift 2 at WWDC 2015. Initially a proprietary language, version 2.2 was made open-source software under the Apache License 2.0 on December 3, 2015, for Apple\u0026rsquo;s platforms and Linux.\nSwift 5.1 was officially released in September 2019. Swift 5.1 builds on the previous version of Swift 5 by extending the stable features of the language to compile-time with the introduction of module stability. The introduction of module stability makes it possible to create and share binary frameworks that will work with future releases of Swift.\n Important external resources #   Swift.org is home to the Swift community.

It provides some explanation about how each part of the language works and what syntax to use.\nVariables and constants #  Swift differentiates two different types of variables using two different keywords when defining them. A variable or constant can be defined without initialising it, but if it is expected, that the variable will contain no value anytime during runtime, it has to be declared an optional using a special ? syntax. Swift is a strong-typed, type-safe language, which means that each variable or constant has to be given a specific type, which it never can change during runtime. Types can either be inferred by defining the variable with an initial value, or given during definition.\n// Definition of a constant with inferred type of String let const = \u0026#34;This is a constant\u0026#34; // Definition of a variable with inferred type of Int var variable = 100 // Definition of an uninitialized variable with explicit type of Double var inferred: Double // Definition of an optional variable with given type of String var optional: String? Swift doesn’t implement special mutable or immutable collections. They are determined by initialising them as either a variable or constant.\nlet immutableArray = [1, 2, 3, 4] var mutableArray = [1, 2, 3, 4] Operators #  Swift comes with all sorts of operators already build in. A lot of these standard operators can be applied to different kinds of types. This part only covers the basic syntax of each operator. Their special appliances on different types will be covered during the description of the specific type in the next chapter.\nAssignment operator #  This operator is used to assign values to variables, constants or properties.\nvar myString = „This is a string“ Arithmetic operators #  These operators are mostly used to perform arithmetic calculations, but could be applied to non numeric types.\na + b	// Addition a - b	// Subtraction a * b	// Multiplication a / b	// Division Compound assignment operators #  Just like in other languages, Swift supports compound assignments. These take the value of a variable, perform an arithmetic operation on it and reassign the variable with the result. Compound assignments work with all four arithmetic operators.\nvar a = 1 a = a + 1	// Is equivalent to a += 1 Remainder operator #  This operator returns the remainder of a division. It’s better known as the modulo operator.\n10 % 3	// Evaluates to 1 Comparison operators #  These operators perform a logical comparison between two objects and return a boolean value.\na == b	// a equals b a != b	// a unequals b a \u0026lt; b	// a is smaller then b a \u0026lt;= b	// a is smaller or equal to b a \u0026gt; b	// a is greater then b a \u0026gt;= b	// a is greater or equal to b Ternary conditional operator #  This operator evaluates a boolean value or expression and assigns either a value A or a value B to a variable, based on the boolean	value.\nvar numberA = 10 var numberB = 3 var comparison = ((numberA \u0026gt; numberB) ? \u0026#34;A greater then B\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;B greater then A\u0026#34;) Logical operators #  Swift uses logical operators over keywords. These operators can be used to form any logical expression, following the rules of basic Boolean algebra. Unlike Python, boolean operations can only be performed on type boolean values, not on the integers 0 and 1.\nvar t = true var f = !t	// The NOT operator (Expression evalueates to false) var a = t \u0026amp;\u0026amp; f	// The AND operator (Expression evalueates to false) var o = t || f	// The OR operator (Expression evalueates to true) Ranged operators #  Ranged operators provide a way of dealing with ranges between multiple objects as they are typically used in iterations or loops. We will deal with these concepts in a later chapter and only look at the basic syntax of different ranges. Ranges in Swift come in one of two kinds. Either a closed or a half-open range, which determines wether the end point of the range is included or not.\n1...5	// Closed range operator returning the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 1..\u0026lt;5	// Half-open range operator returning the values 1, 2, 3, 4 "}),a.add({id:5,href:'/docs/languages/python/',title:"Python",section:"Languages",content:"  Python\n   Wikipedia says:\nPython is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language.

It\u0026rsquo;s energizing and if I really get into something I can\u0026rsquo;t let go of it. I get in over my head. I tend to choose a try-first-look-up-later style of learning. I love to tinker around and if I encounter a problem, I browse the web to find a solution. This often leads to chaos and surely minimizes my learning goals. Now and then I thought about starting a blog to keep track of my ideas and learnings, organize my efforts and saving me from re-learning a lot of things again and agin, because I didn\u0026rsquo;t took my time. I registered at wordpress, blogger and other well known platforms, but was always overwhelmed by the options, templates and payment plans. Since I\u0026rsquo;m also very keen on neat and tidy designs, I could spend hours and hours tweaking a wordpress theme, only to start from scratch later on, only because the theme had one minor detail that bugged me. I tried but failed to run a blog and continued the way it was.\nA few days ago the idea came to my mind again and I hassled around with wordpress again for a while, only to delete the site a few hours later. But I still wanted a slick solution and straight forward workflow, for organizing notes and thoughts. In the following web search, I finally stumbled over the solution to my problem!\n HUGO + GitHub + Command Line = Blog\n An easy to setup, easy to maintain, but jet powerful solution for building a webpage from scratch, without any further knowledge on HTML, CSS or SASS. If you know your way around git, github and the command line, it\u0026rsquo;s very simple to get a site like this one up and running in a day.\nA detailed tutorial on how to set up a new page like this can be found here\nSince a new blog post is only one line of text in the command line away at any time, it should be easy to maintain this blog in the future an let it be the resource I imagine it to be.
