      <description>Host a GitHub Page with Hugo #  This article is a step-by-step guide to setup a blog page like this one. The tools used for this purpose are HUGO, GitHub with GitHub pages and the command line. At the end of this tutorial I will cover automated post creation and site updates using shell functions. Since I&amp;rsquo;m using ZSH as my shell - if you&amp;rsquo;re on BASH, these may not work exactly the same for you.</description>

Now and then I thought about starting a blog to keep track of my ideas and learnings, organize my efforts and saving me from re-learning a lot of things again and agin, because I didn&amp;rsquo;t took my time.</description>
